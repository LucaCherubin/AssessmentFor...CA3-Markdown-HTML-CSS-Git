# Assessment For: CA3-Markdown-HTML-CSS-Git

"start page" is the file I received from my subject.

These are the tasks that I need to work through:
<table>
<tr>
    <th>Number</th>
    <th>Task required</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 1 </td> <td>Set the background color of the page to `c-background-color`</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 2 </td> <td>Set the background color of the header and footer to `c-background-highlights`</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 3 </td> <td>Set the text color in the main, footer, and header to be `base-font-color`</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 4 </td> <td>Links in the article should be c-magenta. (If there are no links in the article, add some!)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 5 </td> <td>When the mouse hovers over a link, it should be highlighted orange</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 6 </td> <td>Create a border around each subsection of the article, including the subsection heading. The border should be solid, 3px wide, and be `c-cyan` in color</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 7 </td> <td>Align the Header in the center, and set the text size to 150%. The heading should be c-yellow</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 7 </td> <td>Remove the bullet points from the unordered list in the nav section</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 8 </td> <td>For the list items in the nav section list, align to the center, and apply a flex layout. (Hint: this is hard. The nav bar needs to be the entire width of the page in order for all items here to be displayed correctly)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 9 </td> <td>Color all text in the aside to c-green. All links in the aside should be c-red, except when they are hovered over, when they should be c-blue</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 10 </td> <td>Set the maximum width of the page to 800px</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 11 </td> <td>All headings within the article should have a top padding of 50px</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td> 12 </td> <td>Set the layout of the main content section such that the 'related links' portion is to the right of the article. (Hint: This might be a difficult task; you may require some additional research to complete it</td>
</tr>
</table>

As I will complete all the task required, I will commit the progress to <u>Git repository</u>.
